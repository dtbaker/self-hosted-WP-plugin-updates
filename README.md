self-hosted-WP-plugin-updates
=============================

This old plugin allows you to self host WordPress plugin/theme updates. 
So you don't need to have them on the WP repo. 

Doesn't work in WP network/multisite, haven't tested it in latest version of WP. 

This code is from 2011 and will probably not work well.
